My name is Lyndsy Simon. I'm just your average geek in most respects - a programmer by trade. I live in central Virginia with my gorgeous wife and two beautiful daughters. Outside of inky things, my interests include firearms, politics, 3D printing, photography, and online gaming. Feel free to head on over to my `personal blog`_ to read more about those things.

*My Inky Obsession* was started in May 2015 as an outlet for my growing preoccupation with fountain pens, inks, papers... pretty much anything that has the potential to stain my hands or my wife's carpet.

My wife thought it an odd obsession at first, but in retrospect it seems like something that's always been latent. Growing up, my mother worked in procurement for a large trucking company; throughout the year she would collect the "swag" given to her by potential vendors, and it would end up in my stocking come Christmas morning. Sometimes I'd get toy trucks and such, but mostly I got office supplies - often, *very nice* office supplies. I distinctly remember being at school in the fourth or fifth grade, using a Cross rollerball. I didn't realize it was a rollerball - it was just a pen to my nine-year-old self - but I knew it was of a quality that far exceeded the generic ballpoints I was using before. I guess I can credit my mother with starting this!

My first fountain pen was a `Jinhao x250`_ - purchased because someone had suggeste I try a fountain pen when I was asking about how to improve my penmanship, and the Jinhao was the cheapest pen I could find on Amazon. I figure that I'd try a cheap one, and if I liked it, spend $30-$40 on a "good" pen and used it indefinitely.

Yeah, that's not how it works!

A few months later I found myself with dozen - literally, *dozens* - of fountain pens, both vintage and modern. My tastes changed as I gained experience with different types of pens and typefaces, until I recently settled on a highly personalized italic cursive.
